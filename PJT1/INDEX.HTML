		          	<ul>
			            <li><strong>1941</strong> - Bronxville, New York, U.S.</li>
			            <li><strong>1967</strong> - Began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center</li>
			            <li><strong>1968</strong> - Defended his PhD thesis on "Program Structure and Computational Complexity" at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree.</li>
			            <li><strong>1983</strong> - Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system. Ritchie's Turing Award lecture was titled "Reflections on Software Research".</li>
			            <li><strong>1997</strong> - Both Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, "for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language.</li>
			            <li><strong>1999</strong> - Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998 from President Bill Clinton for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age".</li>
			            <li><strong>2005</strong> - The Industrial Research Institute awarded Ritchie its Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system.</li>
			            <li><strong>2011</strong> - At the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where he lived alone. First news of his death came from his former colleague, Rob Pike. The cause and exact time of death have not been disclosed. He had been in frail health for several years following treatment for prostate cancer and heart disease.</li>
			        </ul>
			        <blockquote>
            			<p>"Ritchie was under the radar. His name was not a household name at all, but... if you had a microscope and could look in a computer, you'd see his work everywhere inside."</p>
